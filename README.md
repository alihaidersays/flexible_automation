## Description

1. Developed an automated manufacturing cell on the CoppeliaSim platform for robot manipulator applications.
2. RRR robotic manipulator developed using a vision sensor to segregate different colored boxes into their respective conveyors.
3. Path planning and trajectory generation were achieved using kinematics functionality.
